## Main Points
* This site is a GitHub Pages resource hosted on [https://github.com/]
* [Source Code](https://github.com/fitzgera/fitzgera.github.io)

## Theme and Links
* The site uses the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)
* [Minimal Mistakes documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)


* Minimal Mistakes example [Site Starter](https://mmistakes.github.io/mm-github-pages-starter/)
* Minimal Mistakes example [Site Starter Source Code](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter)

* Krish Shen's site and how to make the [Header Sticky](https://krisshen.me/project_website/how-to-make-header-sticky/)

* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)


## Main Steps
* Create an initial [GitHub Pages Web Site](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
* Clone the example Site Starter site on GitHub using the links above and copy/overwrite the files in the  initial site you just created in the previous step
* Update [main.scss](https://github.com/fitzgera/fitzgera.github.io/blob/master/assets/css/main.scss) to:
  * Make masthead/header "sticky" (it doesn't move when you scroll up and down)
  * Change  background colour of masthead/header to  #ac4142;
  * change colour of masthead/header menu  items to white


## To Do....
1. Figure out how to change the footer, especially the social media links and put in a privacy policy link
2. The home/splash page is incorrectly created
3. Maybe embed a Twitter feed on the home page
4. The "hamburger" menu text (on small screens) is the wrong colour
5. Can tags and Categories be used on normal pages.

## Status 
This is a work in progress and I am still learning about the various technologies
