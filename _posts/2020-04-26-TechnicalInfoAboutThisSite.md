## Main Points
This site is a GitHub Pages resource hosted on <a href="github.com">github.com</a>

## Theme and Links
* The site uses the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)
* [Minimal Mistakes documentation]<https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/>

* [Markdown Cheatsheet]<https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>

## To Do....
1. Figure out how to change the footer, especially the social media links and put in a privacy policy link
2. The home page is incorrectly created
3. Maybe embed a Twitter feed on the home page
4. The "hamburger" menu text is the wrong colour

## Status 
This is a work in progress and I am still learning about the various technologies
